#First check if the system has any swap configured

swapon --show

# We will use the fallocate program to create a swap file. Best practice is to create a swap file double the amount of your RAM. 
If you have 1024MB of RAM, create a 2GB swap file.

sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

# Now check if the file was created.

ls -lh /swapfile

# Make the swap file only accessible to root.

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

# Mark the file as a swap file.

sudo mkswap /swapfile

# If it was successful, you should see something like
# Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 2 GiB (2147479552 bytes)
# no label, UUID=00aafaee-51c9-46b3-a0fc-8240c134048e

# Finally we will tell the system to start using our new swap file,

sudo swapon /swapfile

# To verify that the swap is now available type:

sudo swapon --show

# Result:

NAME      TYPE  SIZE USED PRIO
/swapfile file  2G   0B   -2

free -h

# Result:

              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           985M        418M        104M         26M        462M        392M
Swap:          2.0G          0B        2.0G

# This swap will only last until next reboot. In order to make it permanent, we will add it to the /etc/fstab file.

echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# For a server, you should change the swappiness value to 10.

sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10

# Now change the vfs_cache_pressure value to 50.

sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

# To make these two settings persist after next reboot, edit the following file:

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
